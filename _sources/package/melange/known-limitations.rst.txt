Known limitations
=================

Although mostly complete, the current implementation of
Melange is missing a few elements which might be required for
some applications. The following capabilities probably should be
present, but are not yet supported:

- Callbacks.
- Function types. (It is, however, possible to import a
  function as a simple ``<statically-typed-pointer>`` and
  then manipulate it like any other object.)

.. note:: This section may be entirely incorrect.
