:doc:`design`, describes the goals and overall design of the
airport example.

:doc:`heap`, shows you how to build a new class of sequence,
called a *sorted sequence*.

:doc:`nlanding`, contains the complete, working code of the
airport example. This chapter illustrates many techniques described in
the previous chapters, including collections, control-flow operators,
initialization of slots, and libraries and modules. The chapters in Part
:doc:`part4` describe advanced techniques that you can use to
improve the code presented in :doc:`part3`.
