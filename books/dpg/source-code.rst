Source Code of Program Examples
===============================

On the Web we provide updated source code of the program examples in Dylan
Programming.

To uncompress the ``.zip`` archives, you need the info-zip version of unzip,
which is available on the Internet at no cost. For details, see info-zip.
Note that using ``pkunzip`` will not work, because it does not handle long
filenames.

To expand the ``.tar`` file, you need a standard UNIX ``tar`` tool. To uncompress
the ``.tar.Z`` file, you need to use UNIX ``uncompress`` and then ``tar``.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed one of the archives, consult the
``README`` file for more information.

To run the program examples from the book, you need a fully compliant Dylan
implementation that provides a ``format-out`` and ``format`` library, and a
``transcendental`` library. Note that the examples on this web page include
some minor corrections to the examples shown in the book itself. The program
examples are available in tar format (131,000 bytes), compressed tar format
(39,000 bytes), and zip format (27,000 bytes).

Mindy users: We provide the program examples in a version customized for Mindy.
Remember, Mindy Is Not Dylan Yet. The program examples for Mindy are available
in tar format (238,000 bytes), compressed tar format (40,000 bytes), and zip
format (51,000 bytes). You can obtain Mindy on the Internet at no cost. See
the Carnegie Mellon University site.
