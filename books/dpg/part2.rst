:doc:`classes`, discusses types that are not classes, including
singleton types, limited types, and union types.

:doc:`slots`, focuses on slot getters and setters, techniques
for initializing slots, different kinds of allocation of slots, virtual
slots, and symbols.

:doc:`collect`, describes how to use collections, including
strings, lists, vectors, tables, and arrays. It also shows how to use
control-flow operators to alter the natural (sequential) order of
statement execution, including performing iteration.

:doc:`func`, describes the syntax of function calls, the
function-calling protocol, and the uses of functions as objects.

:doc:`libraries`, shows how you can package your code into a
reusable software component by designing libraries and modules.

:doc:`time-mod`, pulls together the techniques shown in :doc:`part2`
in the context of a set of complete working libraries.
