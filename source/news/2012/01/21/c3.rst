C3 linearization
================

We implemented the C3 superclass linearization algorithm in the Open
Dylan compiler. This is more intuitive in some corner cases, and
allows further performance improvements, especially compression of
dispatch tables. It has been merged into the `opendylan GitHub
repository <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/>`_ and will be
the default in the next release (2012.1). A serious warning will be
issued if the new C3 linearization is different from the old
`linearization specified in the DRM
<http://opendylan.org/books/drm/Classes#HEADING-41-25>`_.

Further information is available in the accepted Dylan enhancement
proposal `here </proposals/dep-0003.html>`_ and in the original `paper
<http://192.220.96.201/dylan/linearization-oopsla96.html>`_ (`doi
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/236337.236343>`_).
