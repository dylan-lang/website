Simple iteration with ``while`` and ``until``
=============================================

.. raw:: html

   <div class="row-fluid">
     <div class="span6">

.. code-block:: dylan

    while (condition?)
      // do something while the test condition? is true
    end;

.. raw:: html

     </div>
     <div class="span6">

.. code-block:: dylan

    until (condition?)
      // do something until the test condition? is true
    end;

.. raw:: html

     </div>
   </div>

The ``for`` loop
================

The :drm:`for` loop can be used in many different ways, but we'll
demonstrate a couple possibilities here:

Iterating over a collection
---------------------------

.. code-block:: dylan

    for (element in collection)
      // do something with element
    end;

Iterating over a range
----------------------

.. code-block:: dylan

    for (count from 0 below num)
      // do work
      // count ranges from 0 to the integer below num
    end;

    for (column from 1 to 3)
      // do work
      // count ranges from 1 to 3, inclusive.
    end;

    // Changing the stepping and going in reverse
    for (index from stop - 1 to start by -1)
      // index will start at 'stop - 1' and end at the
      // value of 'start', decrementing by 1 with each
      // iteration of the loop.
    end;

Iterating over a table
----------------------

The easiest way to iterate over a table is to use an extension to
the standard :drm:`for` loop that Open Dylan supports:

.. code-block:: dylan

    for (value keyed-by key in table)
      // do work
    end;

If you want to directly access the keys of the table, you can use
:drm:`key-sequence`:

.. code-block:: dylan

    for (key in table.key-sequence)
      // do work
    end;

Breaking out of a loop
======================

Breaking out of a loop is just like any other non-local exit in Dylan.
Combine any loop with a :drm:`block` expression:

.. code-block:: dylan

    block (break)
      while (condition?)
        if (want-out?)
          break();
        end;
      end;
    end;

A value can be passed to the exit function (``break`` in this case)
and that will be the value of the ``block`` expression. This shouldn't
be confused with :drm:`break`.

Collection Functions
====================

When working with a collection, some additional operations are available
that remove the need for explicit iteration over the collection.

In all of these, the function passed in can be any of:

* An existing function.
* An escaped operator name (``\+`` for example).
* A locally defined method.
* The result of a method that returns a function such as :drm:`curry`
  :drm:`rcurry` or other `functional operations <http://opendylan.org/books/drm/Functional_Operations>`_.

``do``
------

:drm:`do` iterates over one or more collections, performing side effects:

.. code-block:: dylan

    do(method (x) format-out("%s\n", x) end, #[1, 2, 3])

``map``, ``map-as``, ``map-into``
---------------------------------

:drm:`map` iterates over one or more collections, applying a function and
returns the results in a new collection.  :drm:`map-as` and :drm:`map-into`
allow control over the way that the results are returned.

.. code-block:: dylan

    let type-bindings = map(generate-type-binding, all-var-specs);

.. code-block:: dylan

    let strings = map(curry(as, <string>), names);

.. code-block:: dylan

    let c-direct-superclasses = map-as(<list>, convert, direct-superclasses(c));

``reduce``, ``reduce1``
-----------------------

:drm:`reduce` combines the elements of a collection and a seed value into
a single value by repeatedly applying a binary function.

:drm:`reduce1` is similar to :drm:`reduce`, except that the first value of
the collection is used as the seed value.

.. code-block:: dylan

    reduce(\*, 1, dimensions(x))

.. code-block:: dylan

    reduce1(\+, #(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

``reduce`` is often combined with ``map`` operations:

.. code-block:: dylan

    reduce(\+, 0, map(size, qqs))
