Here are some resources for keeping up with what's going on in the Dylan hacker
community...

.. _contribute:

How to Contribute
=================

The `Hacker Guide <http://opendylan.org/documentation/hacker-guide/>`_ has
details on how to contribute to the project.


Report Bugs
===========

Bugs may be reported against the `opendylan repository
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues>`_ on GitHub. If you
know the bug is in a specific library repository you can report it
there instead. If unsure, use `opendylan
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues>`_.


.. _gitter:

The dylan-lang Community on Gitter
==================================

https://gitter.im/dylan-lang/general

The dylan-lang community is where most of the day-to-day Dylan activity
takes place. You may sign in with a GitHub, GitLab, or Twitter account.


.. _irc:

The #dylan IRC Channel
======================

There is usually someone available in the #dylan channel on
Freenode.net to answer questions.  The channel is logged at
http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_logs/dylan so you can always
ask a question and then check the logs for answers later.

Freenode also offers `web-based chat`_ if you don't have an IRC client or
just want easy and quick access.

To discuss coding issues you can `create a gist on GitHub
<https://gist.github.com/>`_ and paste a link to it in the #dylan
channel.

.. _web-based chat: https://webchat.freenode.net/


.. _mailing-lists:

Mailing List
============

dylan-lang@googlegroups.com, also `browsable on the web
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dylan-lang>`_, is dedicated
to discussion of Dylan.  If you have a question that's more detailed
or doesn't required the quick back-and-forth of IRC, this is the
preferred place for it.

`comp.lang.dylan
<http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.dylan/topics>`_ also exists,
but dylan-lang@ is the preferred forum.

Other Sites
===========

- `Twitter <https://twitter.com/DylanLanguage>`_
- `Stack Overflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dylan>`_
